MODEL INTEGRATION: KAVAN PATEL REPO

Source repository
https://github.com/Kavan-Patel/Fruits-And-Vegetable-Detection-for-POS-with-Deep-Learning

Rules
- The core system must run without this repo (stub inference always works).
- Do not copy weights into the main repo if the license does not allow redistribution.
- Integration is optional and enabled only by config.

Reproducible steps
1) Clone the external repo:
   sudo bash scripts/fetch_external_model.sh

2) Attempt ONNX export (best effort):
   sudo bash scripts/export_external_to_onnx.sh

3) Update config and run:
   scale-vision run --config samples/sample_config_external_model.json

Notes / TODO
- The external repo may not include public weights or a ready export script.
- If export fails with TODO_EXPORT_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, inspect the repo to identify:
  - model architecture entrypoint
  - weight file(s) and license
  - preprocessing and label map
- Once identified, implement an export helper and update
  src/scale_vision/inference/external_kavan_patel_adapter.py

Troubleshooting
- NO_ONNX_FOUND: no .onnx file exists in the repo.
- REPO_NOT_FOUND: the repo was not cloned to /var/lib/scale-vision/models/external/kavan_patel.
- onnxruntime_missing: install onnxruntime in your environment.
