WIRING AND POS INTEGRATION

ASCII diagram

  (vision path)                 (injection path)                 (weight path)
Camera USB/CSI  ------------>  Jetson/Server  --------------->  POS/ETPOS  <-------------  Scale
                                (scale-vision)    Serial (rec.)                  RS-232 or USB
                                                   or HID (alt)

Responsibilities
- The scale connects to the POS/ETPOS and ETPOS reads weight from its configured scale port.
- The Jetson/Server connects to the POS/ETPOS as a "reader" to inject the product code.
- The camera connects to the Jetson/Server (USB or CSI).

Preflight checklist (recommended sequence)
1) Confirm ETPOS reads weight from the scale with its normal configuration.
2) Confirm ETPOS accepts a fixed code from Jetson/Server via serial or HID.
3) Enable mapping + Decision Engine and validate end-to-end.

Serial parameters to confirm in ETPOS
- Port: /dev/ttyUSB* or /dev/ttyACM* (on the POS side)
- Baudrate, parity, stopbits, terminator

Safety note
If any of the three links fail (scale weight, product code injection, or camera ingestion),
scale-vision must degrade and NOT emit.
